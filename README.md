PureData/Unity files for CMPM 151 Midterm
Made by Naman Bhushan, Satvik Srinivasan, Nathan Wang.

To make start the project, open the Unity and PD files and enable DSP. The audio should start automatically and you can adjust the individual volume for each noise.
There are 3 sounds, the motorcycle revving which changes based on the velocity, the motorcycle constant, and the checkpoint sound which increases in pitch as the player
passes through each checkpoint.
